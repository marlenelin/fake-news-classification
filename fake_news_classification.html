<h1>Fake News Classification with Tensorflow</h1>
<section id="intro" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intro">Intro:</h2>
<p>Following the previous blog post on image classification, we would be using tensorflow again to perform machine learning tasks —— on text data this time.</p>
<p>While Plague Inc.&nbsp;went ‘viral’ again during the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak due to public attention on the pandemics, my favourite game scenario in Plague In. has always been the fake news mode. Albeit some headlines are straight-out troll, the existence of such scenario still speaks volume about how the deliberate use of modern technology and psychological tricks could be used to infect the world with false information and cause extreme consequences to the democracy and health of the soceity.</p>
<p>In this blog, we would be getting some hand-on combat experience against fake news through the creation of a ML &amp; N-Gram based fake news classification model.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-acquisition">Data acquisition</h2>
<p>The following data is a small segment of a Kaggle fakenews dataset. Each row of the data corresponds to an article. The title column gives the title of the article, while the text column gives the full article text. The final column, called fake, is 0 if the article is true and 1 if the article contains fake news, as determined by the authors of the paper：</p>

<p>To parse the text and perform topic analysis, the first step is removing stopwords, i.e., uninformative words like ‘and’,‘the’,‘a’, etc. We make use of the nltk library to perform such task.</p>

<p>Next, we will create a tensorflow dataset to host our news data. Tensorflow datasets are iterable and well-integrated with the machine learning pipeline. We would write a create_database function that does the following 2 things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Remove stopwords from the article text and title.</p></li>
<li><p>Construct and return a tf.data.Dataset with two inputs and one output. The input should be of the form (title, text), and the output should consist only of the fake column.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For a tf dataset: - Elements refer to a single output from calling next() on a dataset iterator. Elements may be nested structures containing multiple components. For example, the element (1, (3, “apple”)) has one tuple nested in another tuple. The components are 1, 3, and “apple”.<br>
- Components refers to the leaves in the nested structure of an element. - To set up a dataset for ML training, we need something in this format:<br>
ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((features_dict, labels))</p>

Ted Cruz calls return gold standard abandoned 1933. Such voices 2016 presidential campaign emboldened lawmakers seek limit Fed\'s powers prompting current former Fed officials call steps placate U.S. central bank\'s harshest critics. More dozen insiders Fed watchers said interviews concerned next president could sympathetic critics\' views Fed grown powerful impenetrable. Confronted possible Republican push give Congress say shaping Fed policy, insiders say concessions may necessary protect Fed\'s independence. "There\'s deep-seated institutional fear crack door open, kicked in. But often that\'s case," said David Stockton, Fed\'s former research director fellow Peterson Institute International Economics. The concerns among group, includes current former regional presidents, growing despite expectation Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, polls suggest win November, would help Fed preserve status-quo. The worries reflect balancing act central banks face world economy still sputters despite aggressive monetary easing. Central bankers getting blamed overstepping bounds enough bolster growth. Even U.S. economy outperforms, Fed especially vulnerable, ahead peers unwinding crisis-era stimulus. Chair Janet Yellen colleagues warned public speeches private meetings lawmakers initiatives make Fed accountable transparent could backfire. They defending decades-old, challenged, consensus Fed best safeguard long-term economic stability shielded direct political interference. The officials interviewed said Fed could take steps become open, responding promptly lawmaker requests information revealing rules thumb inform decisions rates. "The best response go defensive shell, instead Fed attempt influence terms changes coming," said Stockton. Some even embracing limited outside review Fed decisions - effectively version "audit" supported Trump, Sanders Cruz. While proposals Fed become open explaining informs decisions may get traction, interviewed acknowledge Fed leadership appears unlikely embrace audit major changes policy playbook. The Fed declined comment changes suggested interviews. Two separate bills proposed Republicans Senate House call government watchdog evaluate, "audit," policy decisions tie single policy rule Fed would adopt make public. Yellen colleagues say "audit" would expose Fed short-term political pressures, making policy less, predictable. The single rule policy would "severely impair" Fed\'s policymaking, Yellen warned, New York Fed President William Dudley compared going "on autopilot" face complex global challenges. Concern Republican initiatives particularly strong among 12 district presidents. Freshman Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari told February interview Fed\'s credibility suffered recent economic crisis. The central bank needs abandon "Wizard Oz routine" tells Americans "we mysterious, smart, can\'t understand doing," said. Narayana Kocherlakota, predecessor, told think Fed policy lacked public oversight, central bank address concerns offer solutions. "Optics matter," said. "Simply continue say \xe2\x80\x98we\'re really transparent reason us change we\'re things\' - I think that\'s going work." Shortcomings current approach reiterating Fed\'s criticism proposed changes plain view Yellen\'s latest congressional testimony Feb. 10. In run-up, Yellen held 10 private discussions lawmakers January alone, including call Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairs House Financial Services Committee backs rule-based policy bill. That however stop Hensarling putting Yellen spot, presenting letter prominent economists, including three Nobel Laureates several former Fed officials backed bill, labeling Yellen\'s warnings "apocalyptic" "hyperbolic." Yellen also taken task Democrats Fed\'s planned rate hikes said would disproportionately hurt minorities, saw cozy ties Wall Street. Kocherlakota, professor University Rochester, said scheduled audit, preferably every two years, "very manageable" way deal criticism avoid ad-hoc political meddling. In similar vein, Andrew Levin, former advisor Yellen, suggested Fed could meet halfway supporters rule-based policy disclosing benchmarks uses debates. "It\'s really hard understand Fed use benchmarks help explain they\'re doing," said Levin, Dartmouth College professor, citing example Taylor Rule rates tied levels inflation growth. By sharing information readily, Fed could also possibly improve relations Republicans, current former Fed officials said. That relationship strained drawn-out probe alleged 2012 leak sensitive policy details advisory firm Medley Global Advisors. Republican lawmakers requested transcripts information related case, Fed said limited much could disclose ongoing Justice Department investigation. Others say central bank open review regional structure dating back 1913, regional presidents selected. Today get picked district Fed directors appointed local bank groups Fed governors Washington, little public disclosure. The Fed Congress long history friction. A Brookings Institution paper published last week analyzed 879 bills proposed since 1947 found politicians usually try redefine Fed\'s powers economy falters, noting spike efforts since 2008 global financial crisis. The latest major changes came 1977 lawmakers clarified Fed\'s dual price stability employment mandate 2010, Dodd-Frank act gave Fed greater supervisory powers setting limits future emergency lending autonomy conduct it. "The approaching November elections compound uncertainty Fed," Sarah Binder Mark Spindel wrote paper. "We doubt path forward easy even best intentioned expert central bankers."'

<p>We would be building three models (using the functional API of keras) that train on only title, only text, both title and text respectively to answer the question:</p>
<p><strong>When detecting fake news, is it most effective to focus on only the title of the article, the full text of the article, or both?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the first model, you should use only the article title as an input.</li>
<li>In the second model, you should use only the article text as an input.</li>
<li>In the third model, you should use both the article title and the article text as input.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Applied to text vectorization layer adaptation as well)</p>
<p>As suggested, we define an embedding layer that would be shared by all three models.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embedding-visualization">Embedding Visualization</h2>
<p>A word embedding is a learned representation for text where words that have the same meaning have a similar representation. One of the ways to learn word embedding is through an embedding layer, a word embedding that is learned jointly with a neural network model on a specific natural language processing task, such as fake news classification.</p>
<p>We will use PCA (principal component analysis) to distill the embedding down to two dimensions for ease of visualization while perserving the variations among words.</p>

<li><p>The clusterings simply divide the words based on their x0 weights, so the variations mainly exist there. Some of the significant outliers of the x0 axis are <strong>Trumps</strong> (Trump’s), rep, gop, j, im, more, mr, that, nov. Some of them are more like stop words (I’m, that before standardization) that appear a lot but don’t really mean anything. Trump is an outlier because obviously he’s one of his kind in terms of spreading false information, making false claims, and creating chaos on the social network (Trump’s twitter).</p></li>
<li><p>Meanwhile, <strong>trump</strong> appears somewhere in the middle orange cluster as well as some other politician last name (like <strong>clinton</strong>). The standardization does not collapse trumps and trump into the same thing. So politician last names mostly appear in the same group.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of the x1 axis, one word that gets weighted heavily is <strong>knowledge</strong>. It’s quite easy to think of sentences like ‘currently, scientists have xx knowledge on…’, ‘officials claimed no knowledge of…’ to be in a supposedly ‘informative’ piece of news.</p></li>
<li><p>The rightest cluster has words like <strong>friday, tuesday, thurdsay</strong> that belong to the same category. To the right, there are adverbs like <strong>allegedly, apparently, recently</strong> that seems to be common in all news articles.</p></li>
